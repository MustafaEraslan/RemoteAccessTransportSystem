Hello Coder!

I am here with my graduation thesis called Remote Access Transport System.

So what is this application?

The application works smoothly on all android devices. Connection can be established with the IP address entered in the Text Box. The application provides control of the vehicle.

Let me explain a little with all aspects of my graduation thesis.

Internet of Things (IOT) is designed as a formed load-carrying vehicle.
technology. The tool is programmed to be controlled by an Android-based mobile.
application. With any Android device that has the app, the freight transport vehicle.
connects to the same network via Wi-Fi, creating a PAN (Personal Area Network).
In this way, the vehicle can be controlled wirelessly by an Android device to carry loads.

The remote access transport system project is a weight transport vehicle created by the Internet of Things
(IoT) technology. The vehicle is designed to be controlled by an Android-based mobile application.
Mobile device and vehicle connects to the same network via Wi-Fi and the system is ready for using.
Commands sent from the mobile app with directional buttons are transferred to microcontroller card
with Wi-Fi module. The commands from the microcontroller card are transmitted to the DC motors via
motor driver card. Thus the movement of the vehicle is performed. The Iophy-One V1.0 development
card, which is a completely local product, offers advantages in terms of cost and durability compared to
other development cards. By using of this card facilitates the integration of the project into current life
in many areas.

thanks for viewing.
