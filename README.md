So what is this application?

The application works smoothly on all android devices. Connection can be established with the IP address entered in the Text Box. The application provides control of the vehicle.

Let me explain a little with all aspects of my graduation thesis.

Internet of Things (IOT) is designed as a formed load-carrying vehicle.
technology. The tool is programmed to be controlled by an Android-based mobile.
application. With any Android device that has the app, the freight transport vehicle.
connects to the same network via Wi-Fi, creating a PAN (Personal Area Network).
In this way, the vehicle can be controlled wirelessly by an Android device to carry loads.
